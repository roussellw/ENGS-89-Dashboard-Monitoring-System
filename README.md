# ENGS-89-Dashboard-Monitoring-System
This repository contains the preprocessing algorithm and code needed to implement our Driver Monitoring System for ENGS 89 at Dartmouth.
Currently it houses the Jupyter Notebook containing the preprocessing steps that we wish to implement, and the python script needed to perform these preprocessing steps.
To run this code download Python3 and install JupyterNotebooks, either from the Anaconda distribution (recommended) or through pip3. Afterwards, you can download and run this code either with the test images used in the script or your own images. Either way, be sure to fix the file path if you don't store the images on your Desktop.
